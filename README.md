# Linear Phoenix (Prototype Playground)

The goal of this project is to brainstorm alternate UI/UX flows for the next iteration of Phoenix.

As of now there are no plans to officially update Phoenix to React, but until then this is a decent skeleton of how we could build it when the day eventually comes.

## Sections Partially Converted
   1. Home Page (Shops Change Notifications)
   2. Schedule Period List (Basic layout for calendar)
   3. Admin: Network - List
   4. Admin: Network - Media Lengths
   5. Admin: Network - Day Parts
   6. Admin: User Activity
   7. Admin: User - List
   8. Admin: User - Detail

If you have any ideas on how to improve Phoenix, please feel fee to contribute.

Enough of that...
Clone, build, and conquer!
